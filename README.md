## Professional Self-Assessment

In completing the Computer Science program I have learned all the skills needed to perform as a competent developer with a 
thorough understanding of design, data structures, workflow and teamwork principles.  What began as 
an interest in coding grew into a passion for software design and technology, and the CS program helped me 
define an interest specifically in backend and cloud services. Completing my courses and working as an intern 
has prepared me to meet the expectations and fulfill the responsibilities of a developer role and to understand 
my place in the field of software engineering and development. I have learned to code, but I have also learned 
engineering and design principles, team collaboration skills and an understanding of the relationship between 
developers, stakeholders and users. 

In my time in the CS program and during my internship on a backend operations team, I learned a lot about cloud service 
maintenance, data structures and security, as well as general knowledge about the field of software development, testing,
debugging and much more. I learned a lot about the workflow and general responsibilities of a developer and became familiar 
with services like Confluence and Jira as well as Agile practices. During my internship I was mentored and worked every day 
with a small team of 3 developers, usually working on debugging tickets together for several hours at a time over a Teams meeting. 
I was assigned several bug and feature update tickets, many of which were directly user-facing. I worked in workflow automation 
services such as Jenkins, database and querying services such as elasticsearch and mysql, and testing services like POSTman, as 
well as writing code directly and using git to commit and push code to BitBucket. I automated several unit and integration tests, 
as well as writing code to meet functional requirements.  I became very familiar with AWS cloud services where most of our own 
services were hosted and managed, as well as the security principles and mindfulness needed for accessing the multitude of cloud 
resources and production codebases.  Debugging every day required me to look beyond just the code and understand the many working 
parts of a service, and to see the bigger picture of software engineering and architecture. An example of a ticket I completed 
during my time there was writing an exponential backoff retry function to solve a deadlock error caused when one of our clients 
accessed a mysql database with several devices. 

Aside from my work directly with development, I was also given the opportunity during my internship to sit in on several meetings
and see how the entire process of software design flows. I sat in on meetings with stakeholders and product managers as developers 
discussed functional requirements and time expectations. I sat in on sprint planning and sprint retrospective meetings. I also spent
a lot of time writing and updating documentation on Confluence like testing plans, feature or function justifications and updated 
functionality. All of my experiences and work during my courses and internship have helped to refine my professional focus in the 
field to cloud services, backend development and operations. My professional goal is to enter the field as a backend developer with 
a focus on AWS.  

The artifact I developed during the CS Capstone course demonstrates my software design ability, as well as my understanding of how 
multiple services can communicate and interact with algorithms and data structures. I met the course outcomes of the capstone project 
and demonstrated my ability to meet functional requirements. This artifact works as a ‘password locker’ program, storing and encrypting 
information behind a master password. The program can also store your data in a mysql database. The program is a fully-interactable 
command line program and was written with an end-user in mind. This project demonstrates my ability to research and implement solutions 
to meet requirements and intended outcomes. It shows my ability to build and design functional and reusable code that meets best practices 
and can be collaborated on by any other developer. My code is compartmentalized and abstracted to an appropriate level. I researched 
solutions to the algorithm and database sections of the requirements for the project and implemented them into the program. The three 
enhancements all come together to complete the functionality of the project and all work together with purpose and intention. The three 
enhancements together show my ability as a developer to grasp the different aspects of software development and bring them together into 
one functional project to display my skills.
